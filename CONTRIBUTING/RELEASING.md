## Introduction

This document describes how the release process for the Storybook monorepo is set up. There are mainly two different types of releases:

1. Prereleases and major/minor releases - releasing any content that is on the `next` branch
2. Patch releases - picking any content from `next` to `main`, that needs to be patched back to the current stable minor release

The release process is based on automatically created "Release Pull Requests", that when merged will trigger a new version to be released. A designated Releaser - can be a different team member from time to time - will go through the release process in the current Release PR.

The process is implemented with a set of NodeJS scripts at [`scripts/release`](../scripts/release/), invoked by three GitHub Actions workflows:

- [Prepare Prerelease PR](../.github/workflows/prepare-prerelease.yml)
- [Prepare Patch PR](../.github/workflows/prepare-patch-release.yml)
- [Publish](../.github/workflows/publish.yml)

### Branches

To understand how all of this fits together in the repository, it's important to understand the branching strategy used.

All development is done against the default `next` branch, and any new features/bugfixes will almost always target that branch. The `next` branch contains the content ready to be released in the next prerelease. Any upcoming prerelease (eg. `v7.1.0-alpha.22`) will release the content of `next`.

The `main` branch contains the content for the current stable release, eg. `v7.0.20`.

Sometimes we're making changes that both needs to be in the next major/minor release, and in the current patch release. That might be bugfixes or small quality-of-life improvements. Making all changes target `next` ensures that the bugfix will land in the upcoming prerelease. To also get the change patched back to the current minor version (eg. from `7.1.0-alpha.20` to `7.0.18`), the PR containing the fix will get the **"patch"** label. That label tells the release workflow that it should pick that PR for the next patch release.
This structure ensures that the changes are safely tried out in a prerelease, before being released to stable.

There are many nuances to the process defined above, which are described in greater detail in [the "Versioning Scenarios" section](#versioning-scenarios) below.

The actual (pre)releases aren't actually released from `next` nor `main`, but from `next-release` and `latest-release` respectively. That means that `next-release` and `latest-release` follow `next` and `main` closely, but they are not always in complete sync - which is on purpose. The reason for this indirection is described in [the "Why do we need separate release branches?" section](#why-do-we-need-separate-release-branches) below.

At a high level, the branches in the monorepo can be described in this diagram (greatly simplified):

    checkout latest-release
    merge version-from-7.0.18 tag: "7.0.19"
    checkout main
    merge latest-release
```

## The Release Pull Requests

The release pull requests are automatically created by two different GitHub Actions workflows, one for each type of release. These pull requests are the "interface" for the Releaser to create a new release. The behavior between the two is very similar, with some minor differences described in the subsections. The high-level flow is:

1. When a PR is merged to `next` (or a commit is pushed), both release pull requests are (re)generated
2. They create a new branch - `version-(patch|prerelease)-from-<CURRENT-VERSION>`
3. Bump all versions according to the version strategy (more on that below)
4. Update `CHANGELOG(.prerelease).md` with all changes detected
5. Commit everything
6. **Force push**
7. Open/edit pull request towards `next-release` or `latest-release`

A few important things to note in this flow:

- The PRs are regenerated on any changes to `next`, and a re-generation can be manually triggered as well (more on that in [How To Release](#how-to-release))
- The changes are force pushed to the branch. Combining that with the bullet above, it means that if you commit any manual changes on the release branch before merging it, they risk being overwritten if a new change is merged to `next` by someone else, triggering the workflow. To mitigate this, [apply the **"freeze"** label to the pull request](#how-to-release).
- The version bumps and changelogs are committed during the preparation, but the packages are _not actually published_ until [later](#publishing). This is a non-standard paradigm, where usually bumping versions and publishing packages happens at the same time.
- The release pull requests don't target their working branches (`next` and `main`), but rather the release-focused `next-release` and `latest-release`.

### Prereleases

> **Note**
> Workflow: [`prepare-prerelease.yml`](../.github/workflows/prepare-prerelease.yml)

Prereleases are prepared with all content from `next`. The changelog is generated by using the git history, and looking up all the commits and PRs between the currently released prerelease (on `next-release`) and `HEAD` of `next`.

The default versioning strategy is to bump the current prerelease number, as described in [Prereleases - `7.1.0-alpha.12` -> `7.1.0-alpha.13`](#prereleases---710-alpha12---710-alpha13). If there is no prerelease number (ie. we just released a new stable minor/major) it will add one to a patch bump, so it would go from `7.2.0` to `7.2.1-0` per default.

Prerelease PRs are only prepared if there are actual changes to release, otherwise the workflow will be cancelled. `next` can have new content which is only labeled with "build" or "documentation", which isn't user-facing so it's [not considered "releasable"](#which-changes-are-considered-releasable-and-what-does-it-mean). In that case it doesn't make sense to create a release, as it won't bump versions nor write changelogs so it would just merge the same content back to `next`. This is explained more deeply in [Why are no release PRs being prepared?](#why-are-no-release-prs-being-prepared).

The preparation workflow will create a new branch from `next` called `version-from-<CURRENT-PRERELEASE-VERSION>`, and open a pull request that targets `next-release`. When that is merged by the Releaser, the [publish workflow](#publishing) will eventually merge `next-release` into `next`.

Here's an example of a workflow where a feature and a bugfix have been created and then released to the a new `7.1.0-alpha.29` version. All the highlighted commits (square dots) are the ones that will be considered when generating the changelog.

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': { 'mainBranchName': 'next' } } }%%
gitGraph
    commit
    branch next-release
    checkout next-release
    commit tag: "7.1.0-alpha.28"
    checkout next
    merge next-release
    commit type: HIGHLIGHT id: "direct commit"
    branch new-feature
    checkout new-feature
    commit
    commit
    checkout next
    merge new-feature type: HIGHLIGHT
    branch some-bugfix
    checkout some-bugfix
    commit
    checkout next
    merge some-bugfix type: HIGHLIGHT
    branch version-from-7.1.0-alpha.28
    checkout version-from-7.1.0-alpha.28
    commit id: "bump version"
    checkout next-release
    merge version-from-7.1.0-alpha.28 tag: "7.1.0-alpha.29"
    checkout next
    merge next-release
```

### Patch releases

> **Note**
> Workflow: [`prepare-patch-release.yml`](../.github/workflows/prepare-patch-release.yml)

Patch releases are prepared by [cherry picking](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/cherry-pick) any merged, unreleased pull requests to `next` that have the "**patch**" label applied. The merge commit of said pull requests are cherry picked.

Sometimes it's desired to pick pull requests back to `main` even if they are [not considered "releasable"](#which-changes-are-considered-releasable-and-what-does-it-mean), so opposite of the prerelease preparation, patch releases will _not cancel_ if the content os not releasable.
On the surface it might not make sense to create a new patch release if the changes are only for documentation and/or internal build systems. But getting the changes back to `main` is the only way to get the documentation deployed to the production docs site. You also might want to cherry pick changes to internal CI to fix issues or similar. Both of these cases are valid scenarios where you want to cherry pick the changes in without being blocked on "releasable" content to be ready. In these cases where all cherry picks are non-releasable, the preparation workflow creates a "merging" pull request instead of a "releasing" pull request. In this state it doesn't bump versions and it doesn't update changelogs, it just cherry picks the changes and allows you to merge them into `main-release` -> `main`.

The preparation workflow sequentially cherry picks each patch pull request to it's branch. Sometimes this cherry picking fails because of conflicts or for other reasons, in which case it ignores it and moves on to the next. All the failing cherry picks are finally listed in the release pull request's description, for the Releaser to manually cherry pick during the release process.
This problem occurs more often the more `main` and `next` diverges, ie. the longer it has been since a stable major/minor release.

Similar to the prerelease flow, the preparation workflow for patches will create a new branch from `main` called `version-from-<CURRENT-STABLE-VERSION>`, and open a pull request that targets `main-release`. When that is merged by the Releaser, the [publish workflow](#publishing) will eventually merge `main-release` into `main`.

Here's an example of a workflow where a feature and two bugfixes have been merged to `next`. Only the bugfixes have the "**patch**" label, so only those two goes into the new `7.0.19` release. Note that while the diagram shows the commits _on_ the bugfix branches being cherry-picked, it's actually their merge commits to `next` that gets picked - this is a limitation of mermaid graphs.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit
    branch latest-release
    branch next
    checkout latest-release
    commit tag: "v7.0.18"
    checkout main
    merge latest-release
    checkout next
    commit
    branch some-patched-bugfix
    checkout some-patched-bugfix
    commit
    commit id: "patch1"
    checkout next
    merge some-patched-bugfix
    branch new-feature
    checkout new-feature
    commit
    checkout next
    merge new-feature
    branch other-patched-bugfix
    checkout other-patched-bugfix
    commit id: "patch2"
    checkout next
    merge other-patched-bugfix
    checkout main
    branch version-from-7.0.18
    cherry-pick id: "patch1"
    cherry-pick id: "patch2"
    commit id: "version bump"
    checkout latest-release
    merge version-from-7.0.18 tag: "v7.0.19"
    checkout main
    merge latest-release
```

### Publishing

> **Note**
> Workflow: [`publish.yml`](../.github/workflows/publish.yml)

## How To Release

### Prereleases

> **Note**
> This actually also covers how to promote a prerelease to stable. This is basically any other releases than backported patch releases, which are described in the next section

### Patch releases

All changes should already have been prereleased

### Making Manual Changes

## Releasing Locally in Case of Emergency ðŸš¨

## Canary Releases

Not implemented yet.

## Versioning Scenarios

There are five types of releases that will be handled somewhat differently, but following the overall same principles as described above.

### Prereleases - `7.1.0-alpha.12` -> `7.1.0-alpha.13`

These happen multiple times a week

1. A PR will automatically be opened from a fresh branch `version-from-7.1.0-alpha.16` to `next-release` on every push to `next`. If the PR is already open, it will be kept up-to-date with description changes and force pushing commits. This process can also be manually triggered if needed.
2. The PR will consist of:
   1. Version bumps in all `package.json`s and other files like `versions.ts`
   2. Changes to `CHANGELOG.md` generated as specced below
   3. Changes listed in the PR description, along with a checklist to go through manually
3. When we're ready to release, a Releaser will go through the check list:
   1. Freeze the PR by applying the "freeze" label on it, stopping any actions from modifying it further
   2. QA each PR that is part of the release:
      1. Is the changelog high quality - it's based on PR titles, which are usually bad.
      2. Change any PR titles necessary
      3. Check that each PR content is high quality, has it been tested, are we sure it's not a breaking change, etc.
      4. revert any bad PRs
   3. If necessary, manually trigger the workflow again, to reflect changes to PR titles and reverts (manual triggers should ignore the "freeze" label)
   4. Merge the PR to `next-release`
4. When the PR is merged, an action will:
   1. publish all packages
   2. create a GitHub Release
   3. tag the commit
   4. merge `next-release` back to `next`. If this causes a merge conflict, this will have to be done manually
5. ... the cycle starts over

### Prerelease promotions - `7.1.0-alpha.13` -> `7.1.0-beta.0`

These happen once every 1-2 months

Same process as above, except before merging, the Releaser manually triggers the Action with a "tag: beta" input, that will change versions from the proposed `7.1.0-alpha.14` to `7.1.0-beta.0`.

### Minor/major releases - `7.1.0-rc.2` -> `7.1.0` or `8.0.0-rc.3` -> `8.0.0`

These happen once every quarter

Same process as above, except before merging, the Releaser manually triggers the Action with a "tag: stable" input, that will change versions from the proposed `7.1.0-rc.3` to `7.1.0`. When the PR is merged, the action will do the usual publishing work, and **force merge `next` into `main`**. The following GitHub Action that triggers on a push to `next` will generate a release PR with `7.2.0-alpha.0`, to start the cycle over.

### Patch releases to stable - subset of `7.1.0-alpha.13` -> `7.0.14`

These happen roughly every second week

This process is a bit different from the above because it needs to merge to the `main` branch and not `next`, but the principle is the same.

1. Any PR to `next` that needs to be patched back to stable, needs to have a "patch" label
2. On pushes to `next`, an action check for any such PRs with the "patch" label
3. It will create a release branch (`version-from-7.0.11`) and PR similar to the one for prereleases, except that it targets `main`.
4. Each "patch" PR that it finds it will attempt to cherry-pick to the `version-from-7.0.11` branch
5. Sometimes it might cause merge conflicts, in which case the PR will be skipped
6. When all is done, the description for the release PR will contain a list of PRs that couldn't be cherry picked, for the Releaser to manually do that and solve any merge conflicts.
7. An important additional step for the Releaser is to check that all PRs are actually patches/fixes, and not new features, and that everything actually works, given that some cherry picked PRs could rely on functionality not yet found in stable.

When the PR has been merged to `main-release` by the Releaser, after the usual publishing steps, the action will also label all patched PRs with "picked" so they are ignored for the next patch release.

### Patch releases to earlier versions - subset of `7.1.0-alpha.13` -> `6.5.14`

These happen 2-3 times a year

Given that this happens so rarely on a case by case basis, I'm okay with this being a completely manual process. The only thing we then need to keep in mind, is that all these versioning and publishing scripts needs to be executable locally, outside of a GitHub Action.

### Prerelease of upcoming patch release - `7.0.20` -> `7.0.21-alpha.0`
