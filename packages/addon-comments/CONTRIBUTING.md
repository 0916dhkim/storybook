# How to Contribute

First of all, start the Storybook Hub Backend and get logged in.

> Storybook Hub Backend is a private app and we'll update how to setup this addon for development without that dependency.

Then start the storybook inside this app.

```sh
npm run storybook
```
Now you'll see a comments tab and you can start contrubuting.
