        This is a UI component dev environment for your app.
      </p>
      <p

         We've added some basic stories inside the 
        <span
          _ngcontent-a-c49=""
          class="inline-code"
        >
          src/stories
        </span>
         directory. 
        <br
          _ngcontent-a-c49=""
        />
         A story is a single state of one or more UI components. You can have as many stories as you want. 
        <br
          _ngcontent-a-c49=""
        />
         (Basically a story is like a visual test case.)

      <p

         See these sample 
        <a
          _ngcontent-a-c49=""
          role="button"
          tabindex="0"
        >
          stories
        </a>
         for a component called 
        <span
          _ngcontent-a-c49=""
          class="inline-code"
        >
          Button
        </span>
         . 
      </p>
      <p
        _ngcontent-a-c49=""
      >
         Just like that, you can add your own components as stories. 
        <br
          _ngcontent-a-c49=""
        />
         You can also edit those components and see changes right away. 
        <br
          _ngcontent-a-c49=""
        />
         (Try editing the 
        <span
          _ngcontent-a-c49=""
          class="inline-code"
        >
          Button
        </span>
         stories located at 
        <span
          _ngcontent-a-c49=""
          class="inline-code"
        >
          src/stories/index.js
        </span>
        .) 
      </p>
      <p
        _ngcontent-a-c49=""
      >
         Usually we create stories with smaller UI components in the app.
        <br
          _ngcontent-a-c49=""
        />
         Have a look at the
